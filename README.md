# Password Manager Python

## Project Description

This project is a simple and secure password manager built in Python. It allows users to safely store and manage their passwords for different websites by encrypting the data with a master key. The use of strong cryptographic techniques ensures that sensitive information remains protected, while providing an easy-to-use command-line interface for adding, viewing, and managing credentials. This project helps improve personal security and demonstrates practical use of encryption in software development.

- I'm using `getpass` (the system hides the password when you are typing) to protect the password from attackers.  
- We can create more than one user and vaults.  
- We can access a vault using a master key or create one if it's your first access.  
- After we access our vault, we can add a new authentication (username, website URL, and password) and you can only access it if you use the right master key.  
- I can list all of my passwords.
